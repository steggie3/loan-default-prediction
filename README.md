Loan Default Prediction Machine Learning Project

This is an exploratory project for me to apply what I have learned in the Data Science and Machine Learning courses that I took this year, including:
+ Feature Engineering
  + One-hot encoding for categorical features
  + Normalization/standardization
  + Imputation
  + Feature expansion
  + Feature reduction:
    + Feature hashing
    + Feature selection
    + Principal component analysis
  + Feature discretization with Decision Trees or Random Forests
+ Machine Learning Models:
  + Logistic Regression
  + Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees
  + K-Nearest-Neighbor
  + Support Vector Machines
  + Neural Networks

The data is from a Kaggle competition [Loan Default Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/loan-default-prediction).
